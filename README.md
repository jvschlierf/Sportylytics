## General Info
This repository serves as the central storage for the files (both code as well as data) for the final project of class 20630 - Introduction to Sports Analytics Spring 2022 at Università Bocconi. In the following, we will explain what files we have provided here, the structure that orders them, which models we included, as well as the results we achieved.  
## File Structure

## Models

We ran 4 different models:
1. **Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLS)**
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
3. **Random Forest**
4. **Gradient Boosting**
5. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

## Results
The below tables details the RMSE & R&#x00B2; score for each of the models that we ran. The score presented is the that of the respective best version of that model.
| Model             | RMSE  | R&#x00B2;  |
| :---------------: | :----:| :--------: |
| **OLS**           | 0.040 | 0.715 |
| **KNN**           | 0.033 | 0.808 |
| **Random Forest**   | 0.035 | 0.765 |
| **Gradient Boosting** | 0.036 | 0.777 |
| **SVM**           | 0.032 | 0.821|
